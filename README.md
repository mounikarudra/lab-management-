It was basically built to optimize the work of lectures in lab. Every student and lecturer need
to create an account to login. The lecturer can post the programs to execute and the student
can write a program and execute them in the integrated compiler. The programs will be
saved on the server. The lecturer can also conduct quiz(viva) and the marks can be
considered to evaluate the student.
